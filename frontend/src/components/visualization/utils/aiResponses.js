    "Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order. Best: O(n), Average/Worst: O(nÂ²). Space: O(1). Useful for teaching, not for large datasets.",

    "Two pointers technique uses two indices moving toward each other (or same direction) to solve problems in linear time. Common for sorted arrays, pairs, and subarray problems.",

    "Binary Search splits a sorted array by checking the middle element and discarding half every step. Time complexity: O(log n). Requires sorted input.",
